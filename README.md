Before diving into the project,
make sure you understand the
concept of a wrapper component
in React. A wrapper component
is a higher-order component
(HOC) that wraps around another
component to modify its behavior,
appearance, or provide additional
functionality.

Step 1: Project Setup

-  Create a new React project using
your preferred method, such as 
create-react-app, or set up a 
project using your own custom 
configuration.

Step 2: Identify the Use Case

- Think about the use case for your 
wrapper component. What specific
functionality or styling do you
want to apply to the components 
you'll wrap? For example, you
might want to create a wrapper 
component that adds a loading
spinner, a tooltip, or a specific
layout.

Step 3: Define the Wrapper Component

- Create a new component file for
your wrapper component, such as 
Wrapper.js. Think about a meaningful 
name for your wrapper component based
on its purpose.

Step 4: Design the Wrapper Component

- Decide on the visual design or
functional aspects of your wrapper
component. Consider what props your
wrapper component might need to
receive to customize its behavior.
For example, if you're creating a
wrapper component for tooltips, you
might want to pass a text prop to
display the tooltip content.

Step 5: Implement the Wrapper Component

- Start implementing your wrapper
component based on the design 
decisions you made. You can use
functional components or class
components, depending on your
preference or project requirements.

Step 6: Test the Wrapper Component

- Create a test case or a sample usage
scenario for your wrapper component.
Render the wrapper component in your
application and verify that it
functions as expected. Make any
necessary adjustments to ensure your
wrapper component behaves correctly.

Step 7: Document the Wrapper Component

- Document your wrapper component,
describing its purpose, props, and 
any usage guidelines. You can use a
documentation tool like Storybook 
or create a simple Markdown file 
with the necessary information.

Step 8: Share and Reuse

- Consider sharing your wrapper component
with the community by publishing it as
a reusable package on platforms like npm.
Alternatively, you can reuse the wrapper
component in other projects of your own.

Step 9: Experiment and Refine

- Once you have completed your initial
wrapper component, challenge yourself 
to create more wrapper components for
different use cases. Experiment with
different functionalities, styling
options, or other customizations.
